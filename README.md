# Kntnt base theme

Minimal WordPress theme based on _s (a.k.a. Underscores) with support for Beaver Theme Builder (a.k.a. Beaver Themer). 

## Description

Kntnts base theme is based on Automattic's thorough and well-made starter theme [_s](https://underscores.me/) (which should be read Underscores).

While _s is intended as a starting point for building a WordPress theme, Kntnt base theme is intended as a starting point for building a theme witg Beaver Theme Builder (also known as Bever Themer).

Once installed, your site will look really crappy. You need to create your own header and footer layout with Beaver Builder and Beave Theme Bulider, as well various other theme parts.
